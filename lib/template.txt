    f_in = ''
    with open(f_in, mode='r', encoding='utf-8') as rf:
        for l in rf.readlines():

-
        with open(f2, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as o1:
            for item in new_ls:
                o1.write(item + '\n')



 2. 加载和保存一个模型


     def save_to_file(self, filename,obj):
        with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(obj, f)

        if filename is not None:
            with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
                obj = pickle.load(f)
        return obj
